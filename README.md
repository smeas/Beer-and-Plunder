# Beer & Plunder

Beer & Plunder is a fast paced co-op game where you and your friends get a chance at running your very own Viking Pub! Pour beers, serve food, play music and keep your customers happy to stop them from destroying your bar!

### About The Game
Beer & Plunder is about running a viking bar - and everything that this entails. Running a pub is difficult alone, luckily you can invite up to three friends to play along with you. 

The goal of the game is to make enough gold each shift to keep your pub going. Serve your customers well, and quickly, to keep them paying. But, beware of the tiny thief - he comes out to steal any gold lying unprotected on the ground!

Beer & Plunder is a student project made during a seven week period.
